- 👋 Hi, I’m Will
- 👀 I’m interested in in coding and front end stuff primarily I am reading about security which is another sector i may look into. Outside of coding I like powerlifting, drawing, Comics and Anime.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/SCSS/Javascript and then I think I may make my way to Vue.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects. I'm looking for tutelage and would like to work on other projects with devs with seniority to show me the ropes.
