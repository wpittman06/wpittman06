# About me 
Hi I'm Will, a frontend developer, designer and iillustrator. I am currently transitioning out of IT and decided frontend development was the way to go, as it combines my love for tech, design and problem solving. I have some prior experience with vanilla HTML and CSS but am learning to expand beyond that. I am currently going through the #100Devs program with Leon on Twitch where we will be learning HTML, CSS, JS, React, Node, Express, MongoDB.

# Hobbies: 
   Video games, drawing, powerlifting
